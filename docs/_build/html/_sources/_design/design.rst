Design
==========

The Scripting course at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana was 
redesigned using the Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) framework, 
incorporating the Belief, Expectancy, and Control (BEC) motivational 
framework to address the diverse needs of students in Digital Entertainment 
Design Engineering.

Course Structure and CBL Integration
-------------------------------------

The course is divided into four main phases, each aligned with CBL:

* Engage (Comprometerse): students align the course content with their 
  interests. They define their learning goals and identify the tools and 
  skills they need to develop. A personalized logbook format guides this 
  phase,helping students reflect on their motivations and set clear objectives.

* Investigate (Investigar): in this phase, students build their conceptual 
  foundation by researching relevant techniques and tools. They document 
  their findings in a structured logbook, which includes resources, 
  reflections, and conclusions about their guiding questions.

* Act (Actuar): students apply their research to develop interactive 
  applications. They implement patterns and strategies that meet the 
  established functional and non-functional requirements. The logbook 
  in this phase focuses on documenting the implementation process, 
  challenges faced, and solutions developed.

* Share (Compartir): students present their projects, showcasing their 
  learning journey and the final product. The logbook for this phase 
  includes reflections on the project outcomes, feedback received, and 
  insights gained.

Incorporating BEC Framework
----------------------------

The BEC framework was integrated to enhance student motivation by 
addressing their beliefs, expectations, and control over their 
learning process:

* Belief: by allowing students to choose projects aligned with their 
  interests, the course fosters a strong belief in their abilities and 
  relevance of the content.
* Expectancy: clear, structured phases and logbooks help students set 
  realistic expectations for their progress and success.
* Control: the autonomous nature of CBL, combined with personalized support 
  and feedback, ensures students feel in control of their learning journey.

This redesign aimed to increase engagement and motivation among 
students from various profiles (video game design, visual experiences 
animation, and interactive experiences) by providing a flexible and 
relevant learning environment.

Logbooks
----------

The course is divided into four main phases, each aligned with CBL, 
and includes detailed logbooks for documenting the learning process:

Engage (Comprometerse) and Investigate (Investigar):

Students document their learning process, including reflections on 
guiding questions, resources, and conclusions.

In-Class Sessions:

* Micro-session 1 (20 minutes): Initial reflection and planning.  
* Micro-session 2 (30 minutes): Focused work with an active pause.  
* Micro-session 3 (30 minutes): Continued focused work with an active pause.  
* Micro-session 4 (20 minutes): Final reflection and exit ticket.  

Independent Sessions:

* Micro-session 1 (15 minutes): Initial reflection and planning.
* Micro-session 2 (30 minutes): Focused work with an active pause.
* Micro-session 3 (30 minutes): Continued focused work with an active pause.
* Micro-session 4 (30 minutes): Continued focused work with an active pause.
* Micro-session 5 (15 minutes): Final reflection and exit ticket.
  

Act (Actuar): 

During this phase, the logbook structure is modified to focus on 
application and problem-solving. Each session, whether in-class or 
independent, requires students to document their focused work 
and answer four key questions:

* What aspects of the application do I need to design, implement, or 
  test in this session?
* What were the most significant challenges of the session and how did 
  I overcome them?
* Based on the work of the session, what did I learn, conclude, or 
  synthesize?
* What are the next steps to continue advancing the project?

Share (Compartir):

Instead of a logbook, students are required to submit a final report 
that includes:

* Personalized challenge: description of the student's personalized challenge.
* Research synthesis: summary of their research findings.
* Learning Outcome Evidence:

    * Learning Outcome 1: students describe the architecture, data 
      structures, and algorithms used.
    * Learning Outcome 2: building interactive applications with functional 
      and non-functional requirements. Students discuss version control, 
      design patterns, and optimization considerations.
    * Learning Outcome 3: testing methodologies and standards. Students 
      explain part and integration tests conducted.
* Application Demo: A video link showcasing the application features and 
  how learning outcomes were met.
* Closing Evaluation:reflection on the course value, motivation, strengths, weaknesses, 
  suggestions, and recommendations.
