Motivation
========================

Students are expected to achieve the following learning outcomes:

1. Design software applications for digital entertainment systems using 
   appropriate procedures and tools to meet project objectives.

3. Build interactive applications applying patterns and strategies to 
   meet established functional and non-functional requirements.

4. Conduct part and whole software tests using industry-standard 
   methodologies, techniques, and standards to ensure proper application functionality.

The Digital Entertainment Design Engineering program encompasses three 
student profiles: video game students, animation in visual experiences 
students, and interactive experiences students. Originally, the Scripting 
was exclusively designed for video game students. However, due to a 
curriculum transformation, all three student profiles are now required 
to take this course. The challenge lies in the fact that the course 
content has not been updated to accommodate the diverse needs of the 
new student profiles, resulting in decreased motivation among non-video 
game students and, ultimately, affecting their learning outcomes.

To address this issue, the course was redesigned using the 
Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) framework and the Belief, Expectancy, 
and Control (BEC) motivational framework. The CBL framework allows 
students from each profile to autonomously explore their specific 
tools and tackle a common challenge, which they can personalize according 
to their interests and tools. This approach ensures that all students, 
regardless of their focus, can find relevance and motivation in the 
course content. The CBL framework tailored for this course can be 
found `here <https://idedscripting.readthedocs.io/es/latest/>`__, and the 
BEC framework can be accessed `here <https://riverapublications.com/article/engineering-motivation-using-the-belief-expectancy-control-framework>`__.
